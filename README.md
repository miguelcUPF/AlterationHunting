Welcome to the interactive VR game developed in Unity, leveraging Unity's Render Streaming plugin.

You have two options to experience the game:

Please follow the respective README guidelines provided in the "VR-GAME-UNITY-main" and "WebServer-main" folders to install the VR project and execute the web application for streaming.

This game is open source, allowing you to modify and customize the application as per your requirements. The project consists of four main scenes: the Start Menu, the Game Room (Room 1), the Tutorial, and the Game Over scene. 

## Game Story
Prepare yourself for a collision between universes within the room! Entities from another universe will swap with existing items, and new objects will emerge. Your mission is to remember the original objects in the room and identify the anomalies that do not belong to your reality. Luckily, you possess a portal gun to return these disruptions to their original universes. Your task is to find and restore these alterations to maintain the stability of the multiverse!

##Game Operation
As a player, you will be inside the room, with the ability to interact with various objects. You are given a limited amount of time to observe and memorize the elements and their colors before the multiverse collision occurs.

Once time runs out, the room undergoes alterations. However, a portal gun remains in your possession. This gun visually indicates the number of alterations that have taken place. Your objective is to identify the objects that don't belong to the initial room and use the portal gun to shoot and return them to their rightful universes.

When you correctly hit and return an object to its original universe, it contributes to stabilizing the multiverse. If you successfully remove all disturbances, you save the world and emerge victorious. However, be cautious! Shooting at an object that wasn't altered will create a new disturbance in the multiverse, leading to a GAME OVER scenario.

Embark on this thrilling adventure and ensure the balance of the multiverse! Should you have any questions or require further assistance, feel free to reach out. Enjoy the game!
